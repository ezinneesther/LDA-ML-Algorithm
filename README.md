Linear Discriminant Analysis
Linear Discriminant Analyses as universally known as LDA is a classification and dimensionality reduction techniques that aims to project data points onto a lower-dimensional space while maximizing the seperation between multiple classes.

It achieves this by finding the linear combinations of features that best separate the classes. LDA assumes that the different classes generate data based on Gaussian distributions with the same covariance matrix.
